# Interval Missing Page Sidebar Demo

This repository houses a Minimal Reproducible Example (MRE) that showcases how the side navigation bar does not appear within nested pages. It only appears within top-level ones.

## Installing

```
npm install
```

## Running

Create a `.env` file and set `INTERVAL_KEY` within to the value of your Interval API key (see `.env.example`). Then, execute:

```
npm run dev
```
